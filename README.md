# Building An Affordable Stereo Camera For Autonomous Agents

This research project was conducted by the 2021 interns at Insightworks Nigeria Limited	under the supervision of Engr. Dapo Sosanya. 

## Abstract
The demand for affordable and accurate stereo vision systems in robotics and autonomous agents has increased, as stereo cameras provide depth perception crucial for navigation and obstacle avoidance (Szeliski, 2010). However, commercial stereo cameras, such as the ZED and Intel RealSense, are often expensive, making them inaccessible for smaller research teams or hobbyists (Scaramuzza, 2019). By using cost-effective components like the CHUSEI Web Camera and leveraging open-source tools such as OpenCV for calibration and stereo rectification (Bradski, 2000), this project aimed to develop a low-cost yet accurate stereo vision system for autonomous agents. The final prototype demonstrated 90% accuracy in distance estimation within a range of 1 to 2 meters. The affordability of this prototype could democratize access to stereo vision technology, particularly in educational settings or low-budget robotics projects.
